The basics of a good developer
When we enter the field of programming, we need to build a very developed mindset to help us deal with the enormous pressure in this field. Through Huseyin Polat Yuruk, he explains to us several points about the basics of the mindset of a good developer.

So I will talk about the 3 most important points in my opinion, and I will put a link to the site for you to see all.

- points

  1. When we start a project, we have to understand what is the purpose of this program, and why we need it, as we know when we do something without understanding what it is, we will do badly, and so is the case with programs in programming, so when we make a program we have to know what its purpose, How can we help people through it?
  2. When you start building a program, you have the option to make it simple or complex, so programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity so that a good developer creates things that are easy for other developers to understand and it is easy to get rid of all the mistakes, As for the bad developer, it is the one who complicates things and Makes the easy difficult, so that all developers are considered smart, but the way you work is to prove to others that you are smart, complicating things for others, and from here you put yourself in a situation that you do not need. Simply, you can write the code and put instructions on it even if it is understood. In short, make your code simple and strong from a technical point of view and clarity (simplicity).
  3. One of the most important points is this point when you finish writing your program, you have to resist adding more code and more features until you are convinced that it is required and there is a need to implement it, because a large number of useless changes may increase the defects of your program so always remember what is the need of your program as We mentioned in the first point and follow the priorities set by (Resistance).

  **And this link is for the rest of the points, they are important if you want to develop your programming mindset**
